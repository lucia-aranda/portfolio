## Concept

A responsive web portfolio that includes information about who I am 🪪, what I do 🖱️ and where to reach me out 📫. 

It combines JavaScript animations, CSS/SCSS styling, and modern front-end techniques to create an engaging user experience. The project features smooth animations, interactive hover effects, custom cursor animations, and gradient styling that enhance visual appeal. Also includes PDF export functionality for easy document sharing and incorporates adapted templates that integrate all interactive elements seamlessly. Built with clean code structure, the project demonstrates both technical skills like JavaScript DOM manipulation and SCSS preprocessing, alongside strong design sensibility through responsive layouts and user-friendly navigation. 🖥️

You can explore the DOM structure, inline styles, and event-driven behaviors for both educational insight and creative inspiration. 📚
